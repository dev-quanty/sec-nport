In the US, there is plenty of regulation in place to make the actions of companies and investment funds transparent.
This library focuses only on the reports regarding financial corporations, with the target of tapping into a new source of financial data.
Since the reporting investment funds not only hold liquid assets like equity, but also instruments from very intransparent markets like the CLO market, the reports can be used as one source of price discovery.
