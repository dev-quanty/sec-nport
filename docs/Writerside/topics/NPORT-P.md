# NPORT-P

**Current Status: Implemented**

All registered investment companies except money market funds and small business investment companies (SBICs) are required to file a monthly N-PORT report containing fund information, risk assessments and their portfolio holdings.
The report has to be filed within 30 days of the fiscal month-end and is made public after 60 days.
Before August 2024 these reports had to be made only quarterly.
