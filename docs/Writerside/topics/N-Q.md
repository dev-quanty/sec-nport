# N-Q

**Current Status: Not Implemented**

The N-Q filing was the predecessor of the N-PORT filing.
It required all registered investment companies and trusts to file semiannual reports with the SEC containing the companies contact data and a list of all holdings with the holding size and their fair value.
It was replaced in May 2020 by the N-PORT filings containing more detailed information about the fund's risk assessment and being filed more up-to-date.
